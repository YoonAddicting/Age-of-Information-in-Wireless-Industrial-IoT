This project has been develop as part of my B.Sc.Eng. Thesis in Software Technology.

In order to run this project, place the folder in the root of a contiki-ng folder.

It has been implemented with the Texas Instruments CC2650 Launchpad, with one device acting as the border router and another as the sensor.
